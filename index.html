			<h1>Hard rock for the digital Age</h1>
			<p>John and Sarah met back in 2005, when they were at an open-mic jam session in Lausanne. Since then they played together in a number of local bands. It wasn’t until 2008 when they met Luis, through a mutual friend, that Wired was born. Their unique sound developed over months of practice in Luis’ basement and was further refined during sessions at local festivals. Since 2012, Wired has performed at each Paleo, where their fan base has expanded exponentially. In 2014 they released their first album, followed swiftly by their second 18 months later. Near the end of 2017 they released their third album - their first live-recorded offering.</p>
